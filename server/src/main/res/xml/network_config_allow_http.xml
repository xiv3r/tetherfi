      We currently NEED cleartext traffic support
      https://github.com/pyamsoft/tetherfusenet/issues/263

      Since we are just a proxy that forwards other connections, and those
      connections may rely on checking raw http:// websites like google connectivity
      check, we can not practically add clear text opt in behavior for every local IP address
      and connectivity-check website.
